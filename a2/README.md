What I did: 
- created simple line chart with d3
- added labels to the x and y axis by adding the text attribute to the `svg - Element`
- used `scaleTime` for the x-axis and `scaleLinear` for the y-axis
- used the `brushX` method to allow brushing
- added hover effects with `mousenter` and `mouseout` events
- added `onClick` effect
- added random colors for the lines
